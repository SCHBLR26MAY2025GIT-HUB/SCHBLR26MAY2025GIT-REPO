# 🪝 `useEffect` Hook in Product Fetching

The `useEffect()` hook is used inside the `useFetchProducts` custom hook to handle the side effect of fetching product data when the component is mounted. Let’s break it down:

---

## ❓ What is the `useEffect()` doing here?

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetchProducts();
}, []);
```

### 📝 Explanation of `useEffect` behavior

#### ⚡ Effect Called on Component Mount

- The `useEffect()` hook runs the `fetchProducts()` function **once** when the component that uses this custom hook is mounted (i.e., when the component is first rendered).
- `[]` as the second argument means the effect runs only once, similar to `componentDidMount()` in class components. The empty array `[]` indicates there are no dependencies, so the effect will only execute on mount and will not run again unless the component is unmounted and re-mounted.

#### 📦 Fetching Data

- `fetchProducts()` is an asynchronous function that makes an API request to fetch the product data from the provided API_URL (`http://localhost:5000/products`).
- The products are then stored in the state via `setProducts(response.data)`.

#### ⏳ Loading State

- Before the request is made, `loading` is set to `true`, and it is set to `false` once the request is completed (whether successful or not).
- This is important to show a loading spinner or some indicator in the UI while the products are being fetched.

#### ❗ Error Handling

- If there is an error while fetching data (e.g., network issue, API error), the `error` state is set with a message so you can display it in the UI to notify the user that fetching the products failed.

## 🗂️ Where is `useEffect` used in our project?

`useEffect` is used inside the `useFetchProducts` hook, which is then called in the component where you want to display the products (probably in your `ProductsPage` or similar component).

For example, in your `ProductsPage.tsx`:

```tsx
import { useFetchProducts } from '../hooks/useFetchProducts';

const ProductsPage: React.FC = () => {
  const { products, loading, error } = useFetchProducts();

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div>{error}</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Product List</h2>
      <div>
        {products.map(product => (
          <div key={product.id}>{product.name}</div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 🔍 Here:

- `useFetchProducts()` is called in `ProductsPage` to manage product data fetching.
- `useEffect()` inside `useFetchProducts` runs once to fetch the data as soon as the component mounts.
- The `loading` state controls the display of a loading message.
- If `error` is set, the error message is displayed.

## 🎯 Exact Effects Triggered by `useEffect`

- **First Render (Mounting):** The effect runs once, triggering `fetchProducts()` to get the product data from the API.
- **Subsequent Renders:** `useEffect()` won’t run again since it’s dependent on an empty array (`[]`), meaning no dependencies are specified. Therefore, it’s executed only once.

---

## 🔄 What happens during the lifecycle of `useEffect`?

### 🏁 Before the API call

- The component renders, the `loading` state is set to `true`, and an API request is initiated via axios.

### 📬 On API Response

- **Success:** `setProducts(response.data)` is called to store fetched products.
- **Failure:** `setError('Failed to fetch products. Please try again.')` sets the error message to inform the user.

### 🖼️ Final Rendering

- Once the data is loaded (or failed), the component renders with the list of products or an error message. The `loading` state will have been updated to `false`.

---

## 🤔 Why is `useEffect` used here?

- **Side Effects:** It’s used to handle the side effect of fetching data when the component first renders (without blocking the UI).
- **Fetching Data on Mount:** We want to fetch the data only once when the page loads, which is exactly what `useEffect` with an empty dependency array (`[]`) achieves.

---

## 📝 Summary

- `useEffect()` is responsible for fetching the product data from the API **once** when the component mounts.
- It handles loading and error states while waiting for the API response.
- It is triggered only once because of the empty dependency array (`[]`), ensuring that the fetch operation doesn’t run again unless the component is unmounted and re-mounted.

## 📚 Understanding `useEffect` and React Lifecycle

Understanding when `useEffect` is called and how it fits into React’s component lifecycle is fundamental to writing effective React apps.

---

### 🕰️ **When is `useEffect` called?**

1. **Explicitly triggered by React after render**  
   You do not call `useEffect` yourself. Instead, you declare an effect in your component by calling `useEffect()` inside the function body. React then calls the effect function after the component renders and commits changes to the DOM.

2. **After the render phase (commit phase)**  
   - React renders your component (calling the function component body to produce JSX).
   - React updates the DOM to reflect changes.
   - Then React runs the effects declared with `useEffect`.
   - This means effects run after the browser paints the updated UI, avoiding blocking visual updates.

3. **Depends on dependency array**  
   - `useEffect(() => { ... }, [])`: runs once after the first render (component mount).
   - `useEffect(() => { ... }, [dep1, dep2])`: runs after the first render and every time any dependency changes.
   - `useEffect(() => { ... })` with no dependency array runs after every render (which is usually not recommended unless you know why).

### 🔗 **How does `useEffect` fit into React lifecycle?**

| Phase      | Class Component Methods                  | Functional Component Equivalent                        |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Mounting   | `constructor()`, `render()`, `componentDidMount()` | Initial render, then `useEffect(() => {}, [])` runs after DOM updates |
| Updating   | `render()`, `componentDidUpdate()`      | Re-render, then `useEffect(() => {}, [deps])` runs if dependencies changed |
| Unmounting | `componentWillUnmount()`                | Cleanup function returned from `useEffect` runs        |

---

### 🔄 **Lifecycle for `useEffect`:**

- **Mount:**
  - Component renders for the first time.
  - React commits changes to DOM.
  - `useEffect` callback runs.

- **Update (on deps change):**
  - Component re-renders due to state or prop changes.
  - React updates DOM.
  - If dependencies in array changed, `useEffect` cleanup runs (if defined), then effect callback runs again.

- **Unmount:**
  - Component is removed from the DOM.
  - Cleanup function from `useEffect` runs (if provided).

---

### 🧹 **Example: `useEffect` with cleanup**

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Effect runs after render');

  return () => {
    console.log('Cleanup runs before next effect or unmount');
  };
}, [someDependency]);
```

- On first mount, effect runs after render.
- On subsequent updates, cleanup runs before effect runs again.
- On unmount, cleanup runs once.

---

## 📝 **Summary**

- `useEffect` is called implicitly by React after the render is committed to the DOM.
- You declare effects with `useEffect` but React controls when the callback runs.
- The timing of effects depends on the dependency array you pass.
- Effects run after rendering, allowing React to keep UI updates smooth.
- The lifecycle of `useEffect` matches class lifecycle methods but in a declarative, functional way.
