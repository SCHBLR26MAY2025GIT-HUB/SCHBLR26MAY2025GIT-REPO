<!-- npx create-react-app ecommerce-spa --template typescript -->
<!-- This command creates a new React app with TypeScript support.
The npx command can be installed globally using `npm install -g npx` if not already available. 
The npx command comes with Node.js, so no additional installation is needed.
The npx command allows you to run commands from packages without installing them globally.
The create-react-app command sets up a new React project with TypeScript support.
The --template typescript flag specifies that TypeScript should be used instead of JavaScript.
We use npx to run create-react-app without installing it globally. 
We can use `npm start` to run the development server and view the app in the browser. 
The difference between npx and npm is that npx runs a package without installing it globally, while npm installs packages globally or locally.
npm is the package manager for Node.js, and it allows us to install and manage packages.
