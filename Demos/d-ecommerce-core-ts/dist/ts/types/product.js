// types/product.ts
// The export is used to make the Product interface available for import in other files.
// This allows other parts of the application to define products with the same structure.
// If you want to use this interface in another file, you can import it like this:
// import { Product } from './types/product';
// If you do not export the interface, it will only be available within this file, and other files won't be able to use it.
// The export is a fundamental part of TypeScript's module system, allowing for better organization and reuse of code across different parts of an application.
// In javascript, exporting an interface is not a common practice, as JavaScript does not have interfaces in the same way TypeScript does.
