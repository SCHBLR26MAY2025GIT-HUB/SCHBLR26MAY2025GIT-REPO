<!-- // React is imported to use JSX and React features such as components and hooks.
// BrowserRouter is the main component that enables routing in a React application. It routes the application based on the URL.
// The Routes component is used to define a collection of routes in the application.
// The Route component defines a single route in the application, mapping a URL path to a specific component.
// Navigate is used to redirect users from one route to another. -->
