# The react-router-dom package provides routing capabilities for React applications.
# The @types/react-router-dom package provides TypeScript type definitions for react-router-dom.
# This allows TypeScript to understand the types used in the react-router-dom library which helps with type checking and autocompletion in your IDE.
# The type definitions are installed as a development dependency, which means they are only needed during development and not in production.
# The types package is prefixed with `@types/` to indicate that it contains type definitions for a JavaScript library.
# The `react-router-dom` package is a popular library for handling routing in React applications, allowing you to create single-page applications with navigation without full page reloads.
# The `react-router-dom` package is the standard routing library for React applications, enabling dynamic routing and navigation.
# Dynamic routing allows you to define routes that can change based on the application's state or user interactions.
# Use case for this package is to manage navigation between different pages or components in a React application, such as navigating between a products page, cart page, and login page.
# Use case for dynamic routing is to allow users to navigate between different views of the application without reloading the entire page, providing a smoother user experience.
# The `--save-dev` flag indicates that the package is a development dependency and not needed in production builds.
